How does LetMeKnow work?

Users who want to share their experiences about any product they use share the comment by logging into the system.
Users who want to buy a new product benefit from the system to get information about the product they want to buy.
Registered users can indicate whether they have found previous comments useful.
Non-registered users can only see comments on products.
